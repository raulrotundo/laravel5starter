### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies

Laravel utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar.
Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to
usr/local/bin to use it globally on your system.
On Windows, you can use the Composer [Windows installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe).

Then run:

    composer install

to install dependencies Laravel and other packages.

### Step 3: Create database

If you finished first three steps, now you can create database on your database server(MySQL). You must create database with utf-8 collation(uft8_general_ci), to install and application work perfectly.
After that, copy .env.example and rename it as .env and put connection and change default database connection name, only database connection, put name database, database username and password.

### Step 4: Install

You need to create a database configuration, use this command:

    php artisan migrate

And to initial populate database use this:

    php artisan db:seed

In order to avoid some problems with permissions, change your permission files to 775, for example:

	sudo chmod 775 -Rf /var/www/laravel5starter

If you install on your localhost in folder laravel5startersite, you can type on web browser:

	http://localhost/laravel5starter/
